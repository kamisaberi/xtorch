# Supply Chain Management Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Supply Chain Management Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in supply chain and logistics tasks. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in supply chain tasks such as demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and logistics planning. The examples leverage popular supply chain datasets (e.g., Kaggle supply chain datasets, Walmart datasets) and integrate with C++ libraries like Eigen for numerical computations or ROS for robotics where applicable.
