# Telecommunications Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Telecommunications Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in telecommunications and network management tasks. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in telecommunications tasks such as network optimization, anomaly detection, and signal processing. The examples leverage popular datasets (e.g., Telecom Italia, Kaggle telecom datasets) and integrate with C++ libraries like Eigen for numerical computations where applicable.
