# Legal Tech Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Legal Tech Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in legal technology and document analysis. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in legal tech tasks such as document analysis, contract review, and case outcome prediction. The examples leverage popular legal datasets (e.g., LegalBERT datasets, CaseLaw) and integrate with C++ libraries like Eigen for numerical computations or NLP tools for text processing where applicable.
