# Food and Beverage Industry Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Food and Beverage Industry Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in food and beverage data analysis and operational optimization. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in food and beverage tasks such as quality control, demand forecasting, and customer preference analysis. The examples leverage popular datasets (e.g., Kaggle food datasets, Yelp reviews) and integrate with C++ libraries like OpenCV for image processing or Eigen for numerical computations where applicable.
