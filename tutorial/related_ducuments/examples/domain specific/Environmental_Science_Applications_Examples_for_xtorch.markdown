# Environmental Science Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Environmental Science Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in environmental modeling and analysis. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in environmental tasks such as climate modeling, remote sensing, and ecological forecasting. The examples leverage popular datasets (e.g., ERA5, MODIS) and integrate with C++ libraries like Eigen for numerical computations where applicable.
