# Space Exploration Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Space Exploration Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in space research and exploration. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in space exploration tasks such as satellite image analysis, trajectory optimization, and space data analysis. The examples leverage popular datasets (e.g., NASA datasets, Sentinel satellite data) and integrate with C++ libraries like OpenCV for image processing or ROS for robotics where applicable.
