# Autonomous Vehicles Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Autonomous Vehicles Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in autonomous driving and vehicle automation. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in autonomous vehicle tasks such as object detection, path planning, and sensor fusion. The examples leverage popular datasets (e.g., KITTI, Waymo Open Dataset) and integrate with C++ libraries like OpenCV for image processing or ROS for robotics where applicable.
