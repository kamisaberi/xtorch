# Disaster Response Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Disaster Response Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in disaster management and response tasks. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in disaster response tasks such as damage assessment, resource allocation, and predictive modeling. The examples leverage popular datasets (e.g., FEMA datasets, OpenStreetMap) and integrate with C++ libraries like OpenCV for image processing or Eigen for numerical computations where applicable.
