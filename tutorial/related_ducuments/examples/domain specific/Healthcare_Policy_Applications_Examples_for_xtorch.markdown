# Healthcare Policy Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Healthcare Policy Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in healthcare policy analysis and decision-making. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in healthcare policy tasks such as resource allocation, cost prediction, and population health analysis. The examples leverage popular healthcare datasets (e.g., MIMIC-III, HCUP) and integrate with C++ libraries like Eigen for numerical computations where applicable.
