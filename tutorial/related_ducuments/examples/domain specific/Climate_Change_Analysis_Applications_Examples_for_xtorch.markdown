# Climate Change Analysis Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Climate Change Analysis Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in climate-related data analysis and modeling. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in climate change tasks such as emissions forecasting, climate modeling, and environmental impact analysis. The examples leverage popular climate datasets (e.g., CMIP6, ERA5) and integrate with C++ libraries like Eigen for numerical computations or OpenCV for image-based tasks where applicable.
