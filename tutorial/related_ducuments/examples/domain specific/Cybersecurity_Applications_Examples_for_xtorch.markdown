# Cybersecurity Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Cybersecurity Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in cybersecurity and network protection tasks. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in cybersecurity tasks such as intrusion detection, malware analysis, and threat prediction. The examples leverage popular cybersecurity datasets (e.g., NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017) and integrate with C++ libraries like Eigen for numerical computations where applicable.
