# Agriculture Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Agriculture Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in agricultural and precision farming tasks. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in agricultural tasks such as crop monitoring, yield prediction, and robotic automation. The examples leverage popular agricultural datasets (e.g., AgriVision, PlantVillage) and integrate with C++ libraries like OpenCV for image processing or ROS for robotics where applicable.
