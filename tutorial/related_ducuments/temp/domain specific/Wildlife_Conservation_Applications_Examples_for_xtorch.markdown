# Wildlife Conservation Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Wildlife Conservation Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in wildlife monitoring and conservation efforts. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in wildlife conservation tasks such as species identification, habitat analysis, and poaching detection. The examples leverage popular datasets (e.g., IUCN Red List, iNaturalist) and integrate with C++ libraries like OpenCV for image processing or Eigen for numerical computations where applicable.
