# Retail Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Retail Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in retail and e-commerce tasks. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in retail tasks such as recommendation systems, demand forecasting, and customer behavior analysis. The examples leverage popular retail datasets (e.g., Amazon product datasets, Instacart) and integrate with C++ libraries like Eigen for numerical computations or OpenCV for image-based tasks where applicable.
