# Telemedicine Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Telemedicine Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in remote healthcare and telemedicine solutions. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in telemedicine tasks such as remote diagnostics, patient monitoring, and teleconsultation analysis. The examples leverage popular datasets (e.g., PhysioNet, Telehealth datasets) and integrate with C++ libraries like OpenCV for image processing or NLP tools for text analysis where applicable.
