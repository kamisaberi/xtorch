# Logistics Optimization Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Logistics Optimization Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in logistics and supply chain optimization. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in logistics tasks such as route optimization, warehouse management, and demand forecasting. The examples leverage popular datasets (e.g., OR-Library, Kaggle logistics datasets) and integrate with C++ libraries like Eigen for numerical computations or ROS for robotics where applicable.
