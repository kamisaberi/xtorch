# Insurance Analytics Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Insurance Analytics Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in insurance data analysis and risk management. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in insurance tasks such as claims processing, risk assessment, and fraud detection. The examples leverage popular insurance datasets (e.g., Kaggle insurance datasets, Allstate Claims) and integrate with C++ libraries like Eigen for numerical computations where applicable.
