# Smart Cities Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Smart Cities Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in urban technology and smart city management. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in smart city tasks such as traffic management, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. The examples leverage popular datasets (e.g., Cityscapes, OpenStreetMap) and integrate with C++ libraries like OpenCV for image processing or Eigen for numerical computations where applicable.
