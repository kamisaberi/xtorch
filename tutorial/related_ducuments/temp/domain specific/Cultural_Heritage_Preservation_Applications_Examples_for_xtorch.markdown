# Cultural Heritage Preservation Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Cultural Heritage Preservation Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in preserving and analyzing cultural artifacts and heritage data. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in cultural heritage tasks such as artifact analysis, restoration planning, and historical text analysis. The examples leverage popular datasets (e.g., Europeana, Google Arts & Culture datasets) and integrate with C++ libraries like OpenCV for image processing or NLP tools for text analysis where applicable.
