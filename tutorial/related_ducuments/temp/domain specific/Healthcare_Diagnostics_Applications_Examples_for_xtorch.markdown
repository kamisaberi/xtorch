# Healthcare Diagnostics Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Healthcare Diagnostics Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in medical diagnostics and health analysis. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in healthcare diagnostics tasks such as disease detection, medical imaging, and patient outcome prediction. The examples leverage popular datasets (e.g., MIMIC-III, ISIC for medical imaging) and integrate with C++ libraries like OpenCV for image processing or Eigen for numerical computations where applicable.
