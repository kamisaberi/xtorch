# Financial Fraud Detection Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Financial Fraud Detection Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in detecting and preventing financial fraud. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in financial fraud tasks such as transaction fraud detection, anti-money laundering, and anomaly detection. The examples leverage popular datasets (e.g., Kaggle credit card fraud dataset, PaySim) and integrate with C++ libraries like Eigen for numerical computations where applicable.
