# Healthcare Wearables Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Healthcare Wearables Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in wearable device data processing and analysis. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in healthcare wearables tasks such as activity recognition, vital sign monitoring, and anomaly detection. The examples leverage popular datasets (e.g., PhysioNet, PAMAP2) and integrate with C++ libraries like Eigen for numerical computations or OpenCV for image-based tasks where applicable.
