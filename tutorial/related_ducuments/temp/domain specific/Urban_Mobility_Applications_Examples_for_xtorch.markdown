# Urban Mobility Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Urban Mobility Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in urban transportation and mobility solutions. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in urban mobility tasks such as traffic prediction, route optimization, and public transit analysis. The examples leverage popular datasets (e.g., CityFlow, Uber Movement) and integrate with C++ libraries like OpenCV for image processing or ROS for robotics where applicable.
