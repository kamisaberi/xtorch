# Art and Design Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Art and Design Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in art creation, analysis, and design optimization. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in art and design tasks such as style transfer, artwork analysis, and generative design. The examples leverage popular datasets (e.g., WikiArt, Kaggle art datasets) and integrate with C++ libraries like OpenCV for image processing or NLP tools for text analysis where applicable.
