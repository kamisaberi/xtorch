# Public Health Surveillance Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Public Health Surveillance Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in public health monitoring and epidemiology. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in public health tasks such as disease outbreak prediction, health trend analysis, and anomaly detection. The examples leverage popular datasets (e.g., CDC surveillance data, GISAID) and integrate with C++ libraries like Eigen for numerical computations or OpenCV for image-based tasks where applicable.
