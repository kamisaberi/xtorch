# Transportation Applications Example Titles for xtorch Library

This document provides a comprehensive set of example titles for the **Transportation Applications** category, demonstrating the capabilities of the xtorch library, a C++ extension of libtorch, in transportation-related tasks. The table below organizes example titles by subcategory, with each subcategory containing at least five practical examples tailored to xtorch’s C++ implementation. These titles can be used as a foundation for creating tutorials, documentation, or sample code to showcase xtorch’s applications in transportation tasks such as autonomous driving, traffic prediction, and logistics optimization. The examples leverage popular transportation datasets (e.g., KITTI, Waymo Open Dataset, Uber Movement) and integrate with C++ libraries like ROS for robotics or OpenCV for vision tasks where applicable.
