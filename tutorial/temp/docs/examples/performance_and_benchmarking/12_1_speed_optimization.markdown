### Detailed Speed Optimization Examples for xtorch

This document expands the "Performance and Benchmarking -> Speed Optimization" subcategory of examples for the xtorch library, a C++ deep learning framework that extends PyTorch’s LibTorch API with user-friendly abstractions. The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of beginner-to-intermediate examples that introduce users to speed optimization techniques for training and inference, with a focus on time series and graph models to align with the broader "Time Series and Graph" context. These examples showcase xtorch’s capabilities in performance optimization, scalability, and C++ ecosystem integration, and are designed to be included in the `xtorch-examples` repository, helping users learn speed optimization in C++.

#### Background and Context
xtorch simplifies deep learning for C++ developers by offering high-level model classes (e.g., `XTModule`, `ResNetExtended`, `XTCNN`), a streamlined training loop via the Trainer module, enhanced data utilities (e.g., `ImageFolderDataset`, `CSVDataset`, `DataLoader`), extended optimizers (e.g., `xtorch::optim`), and model serialization tools. The original two speed optimization examples—profiling and optimizing training loops and using mixed precision training—provide a solid foundation. This expansion adds six more examples to cover additional optimization techniques (e.g., multi-threading, model pruning, batch size tuning, graph sparsification), model types (e.g., LSTM, GCN, GraphSAGE), and performance scenarios (e.g., real-time inference, large-scale graph processing), ensuring a broad introduction to speed optimization with a focus on time series and graph applications.

The current time is 2:00 PM PDT on Monday, April 21, 2025, and all considerations are based on available information from the xtorch GitHub repository ([xtorch GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kamisaberi/xtorch)) without contradicting this timeframe.
