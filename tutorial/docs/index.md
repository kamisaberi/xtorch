[//]: # (# xTorch: Bridging the Usability Gap in PyTorch’s C++ API)

## Motivation

PyTorch’s C++ library (LibTorch) emerged as a powerful way to use PyTorch outside Python, but after 2019 it became challenging for developers to use it for end-to-end model development. Early on, LibTorch aimed to mirror the high-level Python API, yet many convenient abstractions and examples never fully materialized or were later removed.

As of 2020, the C++ API had achieved near feature-parity with Python’s core operations, but it lagged in usability and community support. Fewer contributors focused on C++ meant that only low-level building blocks were provided, with high-level components (e.g. ready-made network architectures, datasets) largely absent. This left C++ practitioners to rewrite common tools from scratch – implementing standard models or data loaders manually – which is time-consuming and error-prone.

Another factor was PyTorch’s emphasis on the Python-to-C++ workflow. The official recommended path for production was to prototype in Python, then convert models to TorchScript for C++ deployment. This approach deprioritized making the pure C++ experience as friendly as Python’s.

As a result, developers who preferred or needed to work in C++ (for integration with existing systems, performance, or deployment constraints) found LibTorch cumbersome. Simple tasks like data augmentation (e.g. random crops or flips) had no built-in support in LibTorch C++. Defining neural network modules in C++ involved boilerplate macros and manual registration, an awkward process compared to Python’s concise syntax. Crucial functionality for model serialization was limited – for instance, LibTorch could load Python-exported models but not easily export its own models to a portable format.

xTorch was created to address this gap. It is a C++ library that extends LibTorch with the high-level abstractions and utilities that were missing or removed after 2019. By building on LibTorch’s robust computational core, xTorch restores ease-of-use without sacrificing performance. The motivation is to empower C++ developers with a productive experience similar to PyTorch in Python – enabling them to build, train, and deploy models with minimal fuss. In essence, xTorch revives and modernizes the “batteries-included” ethos for C++ deep learning, providing an all-in-one toolkit where the base library left off.

## Design and Architecture

xTorch is architected as a thin layer on top of LibTorch’s C++ API, carefully integrating with it rather than reinventing it. The design follows a modular approach, adding a higher-level API that wraps around LibTorch’s lower-level classes. At its core, xTorch relies on LibTorch for tensor operations, autograd, and neural network primitives – effectively using LibTorch as the computational engine. The extended library then introduces its own set of C++ classes that encapsulate common patterns (model definitions, training loops, data handling, etc.), providing a cleaner interface to the developer.

### Architecture Layers
- **LibTorch Core (Bottom Layer):** Provides `torch::Tensor`, `torch::autograd`, `torch::nn`, optimizers, etc.
- **Extended Abstraction Layer (Middle):** Simplified classes inheriting from LibTorch core (e.g., `ExtendedModel`, `Trainer`).
- **User Interface (Top Layer):** Intuitive APIs and boilerplate-free interaction.

### Modules
- **Model Module:** High-level model class extensions.
- **Data Module:** Enhanced datasets and DataLoader.
- **Training Module:** Training logic, checkpointing, metrics.
- **Utilities Module:** Logging, device helpers, summaries.

## Features and Enhancements

- **High-Level Model Classes:** `XTModule`, prebuilt models like `ResNetExtended`, `XTCNN`.
- **Simplified Training Loop (Trainer):** Full training abstraction with callbacks and metrics.
- **Enhanced Data Handling:** `ImageFolderDataset`, `CSVDataset`, OpenCV-backed support.
- **Utility Functions:** Logging, metrics, summary, device utils.
- **Extended Optimizers:** AdamW, RAdam, schedulers, learning rate strategies.
- **Model Serialization & Deployment:** `save_model()`, `export_to_jit()`, inference helpers.

## Use Cases and Examples

### Example: CNN Training Pipeline (Simplified)

```cpp
#include <xtorch/xtorch.hpp>

int main() {
    std::cout.precision(10);
    auto dataset = xt::datasets::MNIST(
        "/home/kami/Documents/temp/", DataMode::TRAIN, true,
        {
            xt::data::transforms::Resize({32, 32}),
            torch::data::transforms::Normalize<>(0.5, 0.5)
        }).map(torch::data::transforms::Stack<>());


    xt::DataLoader<decltype(dataset)> loader(
        std::move(dataset),
        torch::data::DataLoaderOptions().batch_size(64).drop_last(false),
        true);
    
    xt::models::LeNet5 model(10);
    model.to(torch::Device(torch::kCPU));
    model.train();

    torch::optim::Adam optimizer(model.parameters(), torch::optim::AdamOptions(1e-3));

    xt::Trainer trainer;
    trainer.set_optimizer(&optimizer)
            .set_max_epochs(5)
            .set_loss_fn([](auto output, auto target) {
                return torch::nll_loss(output, target);
            });
    
    trainer.fit<decltype(dataset)>(&model, loader);

    return 0;
}
```

### Example: C++ Inference Pipeline

```cpp
auto model = xt::load_model("resnet18_script.pt");
auto tensor = xt::utils::imageToTensor("input.jpg");
auto outputs = xt::utils::predict(model, tensor);
int predictedClass = xt::utils::argmax(outputs);
std::cout << "Predicted class = " << predictedClass << std::endl;
```
