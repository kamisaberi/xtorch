### Implementation Notes
- **Repository Structure**: Organize `xtorch-examples` with a directory for each category (e.g., `computer_vision/`, `nlp/`), subdirectories for subcategories (e.g., `computer_vision/image_classification/`), and individual example folders containing `main.cpp`, `CMakeLists.txt`, and a `README.md` with setup and running instructions.
- **User Guidance**: The main `README.md` should list all categories, link to subcategories, and suggest a learning path (e.g., start with "Getting Started").
- **C++ Focus**: Ensure examples emphasize `xtorch`’s C++ strengths, like performance optimization and deployment, with clear comments in the code.
- **Dependencies**: Note that users need LibTorch and `xtorch` installed, with instructions in each example’s README.

This table provides a structured, comprehensive set of examples to showcase `xtorch`’s capabilities, aligned with your goal of rebuilding the PyTorch ecosystem. Let me know if you need code snippets for any specific example or further refinements!
