### Detailed Getting Started Examples for xtorch

This document expands the "Getting Started" category of examples for the xtorch library, a C++ deep learning framework that extends PyTorch’s LibTorch API with user-friendly abstractions. The goal is to provide beginner-friendly, detailed examples that introduce users to xtorch’s core functionalities, such as tensor operations, model building, training, data handling, and debugging. These examples are designed to be included in the `xtorch-examples` repository, helping new users learn deep learning in C++.

#### Background and Context
xtorch aims to simplify deep learning for C++ developers by offering high-level model classes (e.g., `XTModule`, `ResNetExtended`, `XTCNN`), a streamlined training loop via the Trainer module, enhanced data utilities (e.g., `ImageFolderDataset`, `CSVDataset`), extended optimizers, and model serialization tools (e.g., `save_model()`, `export_to_jit()`). The original three "Getting Started" examples—covering tensors, a simple neural network, and the Trainer API—provide a solid foundation. This expansion adds seven more examples to cover additional foundational concepts, ensuring a comprehensive introduction to xtorch.

The current time is 07:00 AM PDT on Monday, April 21, 2025, and all considerations are based on available information from the xtorch GitHub repository ([xtorch GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kamisaberi/xtorch)) without contradicting this timeframe.

#### Expanded Examples
The following table provides a detailed list of 10 "Getting Started" examples, including the original three and seven new ones. Each example is designed to be standalone, with a clear focus on a specific xtorch feature or deep learning concept, making it easy for beginners to follow.

#### Comparison with Existing Practices
Popular deep learning libraries like PyTorch provide similar “Getting Started” tutorials, such as tensor operations, neural network training, and data loading. For example, PyTorch’s tutorials include “Deep Learning with PyTorch: A 60 Minute Blitz” ([PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)), which covers tensors, autograd, and neural networks. The proposed xtorch examples mirror this approach but adapt it to C++, emphasizing xtorch’s unique features like the Trainer API and C++ performance.

- **Directory Structure**: Organize `xtorch-examples` with a `getting_started/` directory, containing subdirectories for each example (e.g., `tensors_autograd/`, `simple_neural_network/`).
- **User Guidance**: The main `README.md` should list all examples, suggest a learning path (e.g., start with tensors, then neural networks), and link to xtorch’s documentation.
- **C++ Focus**: Ensure code uses modern C++ practices (e.g., smart pointers, exception handling) and includes comments for clarity.
- **Dependencies**: Note that users need LibTorch and xtorch installed, with instructions in each example’s README.
