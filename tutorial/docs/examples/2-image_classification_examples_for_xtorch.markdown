### Detailed Image Classification Examples for xtorch

This document expands the "Computer Vision -> Image Classification" subcategory of examples for the xtorch library, a C++ deep learning framework that extends PyTorch’s LibTorch API with user-friendly abstractions. The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of beginner-to-intermediate examples that introduce users to image classification tasks, showcasing xtorch’s capabilities in model building, training, and data handling. These examples are designed to be included in the `xtorch-examples` repository, helping users learn computer vision in C++.

#### Background and Context
xtorch simplifies deep learning for C++ developers by offering high-level model classes (e.g., `XTModule`, `ResNetExtended`, `XTCNN`), a streamlined training loop via the Trainer module, enhanced data utilities (e.g., `ImageFolderDataset`, `CSVDataset`), extended optimizers, and model serialization tools (e.g., `save_model()`, `export_to_jit()`). The original three image classification examples—LeNet on MNIST, ResNet on CIFAR-10, and transfer learning—provide a solid foundation. This expansion adds seven more examples to cover additional architectures (e.g., VGG, MobileNet, Vision Transformers), datasets (e.g., Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-100, Pascal VOC), and techniques (e.g., data augmentation, multi-label classification), ensuring a broad introduction to image classification with xtorch.

The current time is 07:15 AM PDT on Monday, April 21, 2025, and all considerations are based on available information from the xtorch GitHub repository ([xtorch GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kamisaberi/xtorch)) without contradicting this timeframe.

The examples align with xtorch’s goal of simplifying deep learning in C++, making them ideal for the `xtorch-examples` repository’s image classification section.

#### Comparison with Existing Practices
Popular deep learning libraries like PyTorch provide similar image classification tutorials, such as “Training a Classifier” ([PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)), which covers CNNs on CIFAR-10. The proposed xtorch examples mirror this approach but adapt it to C++, emphasizing xtorch’s unique features like the Trainer API, lightweight model support, and C++ performance. They also include modern techniques (e.g., Vision Transformers, multi-label classification) to stay relevant to current trends.

- **User Guidance**: The main `README.md` should list all examples, suggest a learning path (e.g., start with LeNet, then ResNet), and link to xtorch’s documentation.
- **C++ Focus**: Ensure code uses modern C++ practices (e.g., smart pointers, exception handling) and includes detailed comments for clarity.
- **Dependencies**: Note that users need LibTorch, xtorch, and datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, Pascal VOC) installed, with download instructions in each README.
