### Detailed Object Detection Examples for xtorch

This document expands the "Computer Vision -> Object Detection" subcategory of examples for the xtorch library, a C++ deep learning framework that extends PyTorch’s LibTorch API with user-friendly abstractions. The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of beginner-to-intermediate examples that introduce users to object detection tasks, showcasing xtorch’s capabilities in model building, training, data handling, and integration with C++ ecosystems. These examples are designed to be included in the `xtorch-examples` repository, helping users learn object detection in C++.

#### Background and Context
xtorch simplifies deep learning for C++ developers by offering high-level model classes (e.g., `XTModule`, `ResNetExtended`, `XTCNN`), a streamlined training loop via the Trainer module, enhanced data utilities (e.g., `ImageFolderDataset`, `CSVDataset`), extended optimizers, and model serialization tools (e.g., `save_model()`, `export_to_jit()`). The original two object detection examples—Faster R-CNN and YOLOv3 on COCO—provide a solid foundation. This expansion adds six more examples to cover additional architectures (e.g., SSD, DETR, CenterNet, YOLOv5), datasets (e.g., Pascal VOC, custom datasets), and techniques (e.g., anchor-free detection, real-time inference), ensuring a broad introduction to object detection with xtorch.

The current time is 07:30 AM PDT on Monday, April 21, 2025, and all considerations are based on available information from the xtorch GitHub repository ([xtorch GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kamisaberi/xtorch)) without contradicting this timeframe.

#### Expanded Examples
The following table provides a detailed list of eight "Computer Vision -> Object Detection" examples, including the original two and six new ones. Each example is designed to be standalone, with a clear focus on a specific object detection concept or xtorch feature, making it accessible for users.

#### Implementation Details
Each example should be implemented as a standalone C++ program in the `xtorch-examples` repository, with the following structure:
- **Source Code**: A `main.cpp` file containing the example code, using xtorch’s API (e.g., `xtorch::nn`, `xtorch::data`, `xtorch::optim`) and, where applicable, OpenCV for preprocessing or visualization.
- **Build Instructions**: A `CMakeLists.txt` file to compile the example, linking against xtorch, LibTorch, and OpenCV (if needed).
- **README.md**: A detailed guide explaining the example’s purpose, prerequisites (e.g., LibTorch, dataset downloads, OpenCV), steps to run, and expected outputs (e.g., mAP, FPS, or visualized bounding boxes).
- **Dependencies**: Ensure users have xtorch, LibTorch, and datasets (e.g., COCO, Pascal VOC) installed, with download instructions in each README. For OpenCV integration, include setup instructions.

For example, the “Implementing DETR for End-to-End Object Detection” might include:

#### Comparison with Existing Practices
Popular deep learning libraries like PyTorch provide object detection tutorials, such as “TorchVision Object Detection Finetuning Tutorial” ([PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)), which covers Faster R-CNN on custom datasets. The proposed xtorch examples mirror this approach but adapt it to C++, emphasizing xtorch’s unique features like the Trainer API, real-time performance, and OpenCV integration. They also include modern architectures (e.g., DETR, CenterNet) to stay relevant to current trends, as seen in repositories like “ultralytics/yolov5” ([GitHub - ultralytics/yolov5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)).

#### Implementation Notes
- **Directory Structure**: Organize `xtorch-examples` with a `computer_vision/object_detection/` directory, containing subdirectories for each example (e.g., `faster_rcnn_coco/`, `yolov3_coco/`).
- **User Guidance**: The main `README.md` should list all examples, suggest a learning path (e.g., start with SSD, then Faster R-CNN, then DETR), and link to xtorch’s documentation.
- **C++ Focus**: Ensure code uses modern C++ practices (e.g., smart pointers, exception handling) and includes detailed comments for clarity.
- **Dependencies**: Note that users need LibTorch, xtorch, datasets (e.g., COCO, Pascal VOC), and optionally OpenCV installed, with download and setup instructions in each README.
