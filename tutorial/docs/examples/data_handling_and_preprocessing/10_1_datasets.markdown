### Detailed Datasets Examples for xtorch

This document expands the "Data Handling and Preprocessing -> Datasets" subcategory of examples for the xtorch library, a C++ deep learning framework that extends PyTorch’s LibTorch API with user-friendly abstractions. The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of beginner-to-intermediate examples that introduce users to dataset handling and preprocessing tasks, with a focus on time series and graph datasets to align with the broader "Time Series and Graph" context. These examples showcase xtorch’s capabilities in data loading, preprocessing, and integration with C++ ecosystems, and are designed to be included in the `xtorch-examples` repository, helping users learn dataset management in C++.

#### Background and Context
xtorch simplifies deep learning for C++ developers by offering high-level model classes (e.g., `XTModule`, `ResNetExtended`, `XTCNN`), a streamlined training loop via the Trainer module, enhanced data utilities (e.g., `ImageFolderDataset`, `CSVDataset`), extended optimizers, and model serialization tools. The original two dataset examples—using built-in datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10 and creating custom datasets with `ImageFolderDataset`—provide a solid foundation. This expansion adds six more examples to cover additional dataset types (e.g., time series, graphs, streaming data), loading mechanisms (e.g., CSV, graph structures), and preprocessing techniques (e.g., normalization, augmentation, subgraph sampling), ensuring a broad introduction to dataset handling with a focus on time series and graph applications.

The current time is 12:30 PM PDT on Monday, April 21, 2025, and all considerations are based on available information from the xtorch GitHub repository ([xtorch GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kamisaberi/xtorch)) without contradicting this timeframe.

#### Expanded Examples
The following table provides a detailed list of eight "Data Handling and Preprocessing -> Datasets" examples, including the original two and six new ones. Each example is designed to be standalone, with a clear focus on a specific dataset handling or preprocessing concept or xtorch feature, making it accessible for users.

#### Comparison with Existing Practices
Popular deep learning libraries like PyTorch provide dataset tutorials, such as “Writing Custom Datasets” ([PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)), which cover Python-based dataset handling. The proposed xtorch examples adapt this approach to C++, leveraging xtorch’s data utilities and C++ performance. They also include time series and graph-specific datasets (e.g., UCI, Cora, QM9) and advanced handling scenarios (e.g., streaming, large-scale batch processing) to align with the category and modern data processing trends, as seen in repositories like “pyg-team/pytorch_geometric” for graph data handling ([GitHub - pyg-team/pytorch_geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric)).

#### Implementation Notes
- **Directory Structure**: Organize `xtorch-examples` with a `data_handling_and_preprocessing/datasets/` directory, containing subdirectories for each example (e.g., `builtin_mnist_cifar10/`, `timeseries_csv_uci/`).
- **User Guidance**: The main `README.md` should list all examples, suggest a learning path (e.g., start with built-in datasets, then custom image datasets, then graph datasets), and link to xtorch’s documentation.
- **C++ Focus**: Ensure code uses modern C++ practices (e.g., smart pointers, exception handling) and includes detailed comments for clarity.
- **Dependencies**: Note that users need LibTorch, xtorch, datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, UCI Appliances, Cora, QM9, PhysioNet ECG, PPI, custom IoT), and optionally OpenCV installed, with download and setup instructions in each README. Graph data handling may require custom utilities or integration with C++ graph libraries.
