### Detailed Text Classification Examples for xtorch

This document expands the "Natural Language Processing -> Text Classification" subcategory of examples for the xtorch library, a C++ deep learning framework that extends PyTorch’s LibTorch API with user-friendly abstractions. The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of beginner-to-intermediate examples that introduce users to text classification tasks, showcasing xtorch’s capabilities in model building, training, data handling, and integration with C++ ecosystems. These examples are designed to be included in the `xtorch-examples` repository, helping users learn NLP in C++.

#### Background and Context
xtorch simplifies deep learning for C++ developers by offering high-level model classes (e.g., `XTModule`, `ResNetExtended`, `XTCNN`), a streamlined training loop via the Trainer module, enhanced data utilities (e.g., `ImageFolderDataset`, `CSVDataset`), extended optimizers, and model serialization tools (e.g., `save_model()`, `export_to_jit()`). The original two text classification examples—RNNs on IMDB and Transformers on a custom dataset—provide a solid foundation. This expansion adds six more examples to cover additional architectures (e.g., LSTM, CNN, BERT), datasets (e.g., SST-2, AG News, Yelp Reviews), and techniques (e.g., multi-label classification, zero-shot learning, real-time inference), ensuring a broad introduction to text classification with xtorch.

The current time is 08:15 AM PDT on Monday, April 21, 2025, and all considerations are based on available information from the xtorch GitHub repository ([xtorch GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kamisaberi/xtorch)) without contradicting this timeframe.

#### Expanded Examples
The following table provides a detailed list of eight "Natural Language Processing -> Text Classification" examples, including the original two and six new ones. Each example is designed to be standalone, with a clear focus on a specific text classification concept or xtorch feature, making it accessible for users.

#### Comparison with Existing Practices
Popular deep learning libraries like PyTorch provide text classification tutorials, such as “Text Classification with TorchText” ([PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)), which covers RNNs and Transformers on datasets like IMDB. The proposed xtorch examples mirror this approach but adapt it to C++, emphasizing xtorch’s unique features like the Trainer API, real-time performance, and OpenCV integration. They also include modern techniques (e.g., zero-shot learning, BERT fine-tuning) to stay relevant to current trends, as seen in repositories like “huggingface/transformers” ([GitHub - huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)).

#### Implementation Notes
- **Directory Structure**: Organize `xtorch-examples` with a `natural_language_processing/text_classification/` directory, containing subdirectories for each example (e.g., `rnn_imdb/`, `transformer_custom/`).
- **User Guidance**: The main `README.md` should list all examples, suggest a learning path (e.g., start with RNNs, then LSTMs, then BERT), and link to xtorch’s documentation.
- **C++ Focus**: Ensure code uses modern C++ practices (e.g., smart pointers, exception handling) and includes detailed comments for clarity.
- **Dependencies**: Note that users need LibTorch, xtorch, datasets (e.g., IMDB, SST-2, Jigsaw Toxic Comments, AG News, Yelp Reviews), and optionally OpenCV, GloVe embeddings, or pre-trained BERT models installed, with download and setup instructions in each README.
