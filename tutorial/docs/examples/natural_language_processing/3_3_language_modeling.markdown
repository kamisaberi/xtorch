### Detailed Language Modeling Examples for xtorch

This document expands the "Natural Language Processing -> Language Modeling" subcategory of examples for the xtorch library, a C++ deep learning framework that extends PyTorch’s LibTorch API with user-friendly abstractions. The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of beginner-to-intermediate examples that introduce users to language modeling tasks, showcasing xtorch’s capabilities in model building, training, data handling, and integration with C++ ecosystems. These examples are designed to be included in the `xtorch-examples` repository, helping users learn language modeling in C++.

#### Background and Context
xtorch simplifies deep learning for C++ developers by offering high-level model classes (e.g., `XTModule`, `ResNetExtended`, `XTCNN`), a streamlined training loop via the Trainer module, enhanced data utilities (e.g., `ImageFolderDataset`, `CSVDataset`), extended optimizers, and model serialization tools (e.g., `save_model()`, `export_to_jit()`). The original two language modeling examples—training a GPT-like model and fine-tuning BERT—provide a solid foundation. This expansion adds six more examples to cover additional architectures (e.g., LSTM, Transformer-XL, RoBERTa, T5), datasets (e.g., WikiText-103, Penn Treebank, BookCorpus, C4), and techniques (e.g., causal language modeling, masked language modeling, zero-shot generation), ensuring a broad introduction to language modeling with xtorch.

The current time is 08:45 AM PDT on Monday, April 21, 2025, and all considerations are based on available information from the xtorch GitHub repository ([xtorch GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kamisaberi/xtorch)) without contradicting this timeframe.

#### Expanded Examples
The following table provides a detailed list of eight "Natural Language Processing -> Language Modeling" examples, including the original two and six new ones. Each example is designed to be standalone, with a clear focus on a specific language modeling concept or xtorch feature, making it accessible for users.

The examples align with xtorch’s goal of simplifying deep learning in C++, making them ideal for the `xtorch-examples` repository’s language modeling section.

#### Comparison with Existing Practices
Popular deep learning libraries like PyTorch provide language modeling tutorials, such as “Language Modeling with nn.Transformer and TorchText” ([PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)), which covers Transformer-based modeling. The proposed xtorch examples mirror this approach but adapt it to C++, emphasizing xtorch’s unique features like the Trainer API, real-time performance, and OpenCV integration. They also include modern architectures (e.g., T5, Transformer-XL) and techniques (e.g., zero-shot learning) to stay relevant to current trends, as seen in repositories like “huggingface/transformers” ([GitHub - huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)).

#### Implementation Notes
- **Directory Structure**: Organize `xtorch-examples` with a `natural_language_processing/language_modeling/` directory, containing subdirectories for each example (e.g., `gpt_wikitext103/`, `bert_finetuning/`).
- **User Guidance**: The main `README.md` should list all examples, suggest a learning path (e.g., start with LSTMs, then GPT, then T5), and link to xtorch’s documentation.
- **C++ Focus**: Ensure code uses modern C++ practices (e.g., smart pointers, exception handling) and includes detailed comments for clarity.
- **Dependencies**: Note that users need LibTorch, xtorch, datasets (e.g., WikiText-103, Penn Treebank, BookCorpus, SQuAD, GLUE, C4), and optionally OpenCV or pre-trained models (e.g., BERT, T5, GPT) installed, with download and setup instructions in each README.
