### Detailed Forecasting Examples for xtorch

This document expands the "Time Series and Sequential Data -> Forecasting" subcategory of examples for the xtorch library, a C++ deep learning framework that extends PyTorch’s LibTorch API with user-friendly abstractions. The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of beginner-to-intermediate examples that introduce users to time series forecasting tasks, showcasing xtorch’s capabilities in model building, training, data handling, and integration with C++ ecosystems. These examples are designed to be included in the `xtorch-examples` repository, helping users learn time series forecasting in C++.

#### Background and Context
xtorch simplifies deep learning for C++ developers by offering high-level model classes (e.g., `XTModule`, `ResNetExtended`, `XTCNN`), a streamlined training loop via the Trainer module, enhanced data utilities (e.g., `ImageFolderDataset`, `CSVDataset`), extended optimizers, and model serialization tools (e.g., `save_model()`, `export_to_jit()`). The original two forecasting examples—LSTM on stock prices and Temporal Fusion Transformer on Electricity—provide a solid foundation. This expansion adds six more examples to cover additional architectures (e.g., GRU, Transformer, Informer, DeepVAR), datasets (e.g., M4, Weather, ETT, Traffic), and techniques (e.g., multi-step forecasting, probabilistic forecasting, real-time forecasting), ensuring a broad introduction to time series forecasting with xtorch.

The current time is 09:30 AM PDT on Monday, April 21, 2025, and all considerations are based on available information from the xtorch GitHub repository ([xtorch GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kamisaberi/xtorch)) without contradicting this timeframe.

#### Expanded Examples
The following table provides a detailed list of eight "Time Series and Sequential Data -> Forecasting" examples, including the original two and six new ones. Each example is designed to be standalone, with a clear focus on a specific forecasting concept or xtorch feature, making it accessible for users.

#### Comparison with Existing Practices
Popular deep learning libraries like PyTorch provide time series forecasting tutorials, such as “Time Series Prediction with LSTM” ([PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)), which covers LSTMs for sequential data. The proposed xtorch examples mirror this approach but adapt it to C++, emphasizing xtorch’s unique features like the Trainer API, real-time performance, and OpenCV integration. They also include modern architectures (e.g., Informer, DeepVAR) and tasks (e.g., probabilistic forecasting, anomaly detection) to stay relevant to current trends, as seen in repositories like “zalandoresearch/pytorch-ts” ([GitHub - zalandoresearch/pytorch-ts](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/pytorch-ts)).

#### Implementation Notes
- **Directory Structure**: Organize `xtorch-examples` with a `time_series_and_sequential_data/forecasting/` directory, containing subdirectories for each example (e.g., `lstm_stock_prices/`, `tft_electricity/`).
- **User Guidance**: The main `README.md` should list all examples, suggest a learning path (e.g., start with LSTMs, then Transformers, then Informer), and link to xtorch’s documentation.
- **C++ Focus**: Ensure code uses modern C++ practices (e.g., smart pointers, exception handling) and includes detailed comments for clarity.
- **Dependencies**: Note that users need LibTorch, xtorch, datasets (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Electricity, M4, Jena Climate, ETT, Traffic), and optionally OpenCV installed, with download and setup instructions in each README.
