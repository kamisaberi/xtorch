### Detailed Graph-Level Tasks Examples for xtorch

This document expands the "Time Series and Graph Neural Networks -> Graph-Level Tasks" subcategory of examples for the xtorch library, a C++ deep learning framework that extends PyTorch’s LibTorch API with user-friendly abstractions. The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of beginner-to-intermediate examples that introduce users to graph-level tasks in graph neural networks (GNNs), showcasing xtorch’s capabilities in model building, training, data handling, and integration with C++ ecosystems. These examples are designed to be included in the `xtorch-examples` repository, helping users learn graph-level GNN tasks in C++.

#### Background and Context
xtorch simplifies deep learning for C++ developers by offering high-level model classes (e.g., `XTModule`, `ResNetExtended`, `XTCNN`), a streamlined training loop via the Trainer module, enhanced data utilities (e.g., `ImageFolderDataset`, `CSVDataset`), extended optimizers, and model serialization tools (e.g., `save_model()`, `export_to_jit()`). The original two graph-level task examples—DiffPool for graph classification and Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) for molecular property prediction—provide a solid foundation. This expansion adds six more examples to cover additional architectures (e.g., GIN, GraphSAGE, EdgeConv), datasets (e.g., OGBG-MolHIV, ZINC, MUTAG), and techniques (e.g., graph pooling, transfer learning, real-time visualization), ensuring a broad introduction to graph-level tasks with xtorch.

The current time is 10:45 AM PDT on Monday, April 21, 2025, and all considerations are based on available information from the xtorch GitHub repository ([xtorch GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kamisaberi/xtorch)) without contradicting this timeframe.

#### Expanded Examples
The following table provides a detailed list of eight "Time Series and Graph Neural Networks -> Graph-Level Tasks" examples, including the original two and six new ones. Each example is designed to be standalone, with a clear focus on a specific graph-level GNN concept or xtorch feature, making it accessible for users.

#### Implementation Details
Each example should be implemented as a standalone C++ program in the `xtorch-examples` repository, with the following structure:
- **Source Code**: A `main.cpp` file containing the example code, using xtorch’s API (e.g., `xtorch::nn`, `xtorch::data`, `xtorch::optim`) and, where applicable, OpenCV for visualization.
- **Build Instructions**: A `CMakeLists.txt` file to compile the example, linking against xtorch, LibTorch, and OpenCV (if needed).
- **README.md**: A detailed guide explaining the example’s purpose, prerequisites (e.g., LibTorch, graph dataset downloads, OpenCV), steps to run, and expected outputs (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, MAE, ROC-AUC, or visualized graph labels).
- **Dependencies**: Ensure users have xtorch, LibTorch, and graph datasets (e.g., TUDataset, QM9, OGBG-MolHIV, ZINC, OGBG-MolPCBA, MUTAG) installed, with download instructions in each README. For OpenCV integration, include setup instructions. Graph data handling may require libraries like PyTorch Geometric’s C++ equivalents or custom graph utilities in xtorch.

For example, the “Graph Classification with Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN) on OGBG-MolHIV” might include:
- **Code**: Define a GIN model with `xtorch::nn` for graph convolutions with sum aggregation, process OGBG-MolHIV graph data (nodes, edges, features), train with binary cross-entropy loss using `xtorch::optim::Adam`, and evaluate ROC-AUC using xtorch’s metrics module.
- **Build**: Use CMake to link against xtorch and LibTorch, specifying paths to OGBG-MolHIV data.
- **README**: Explain GIN’s expressive power and its role in molecular classification, provide compilation commands, and show sample output (e.g., ROC-AUC of ~0.80 on OGBG-MolHIV test set).

#### Why These Examples?
These examples are designed to:
- **Cover Core Concepts**: From DiffPool and MPNNs to GIN, GraphSAGE, EdgeConv, and global attention pooling, they introduce key graph-level GNN paradigms, covering classification and regression tasks.
- **Leverage xtorch’s Strengths**: They highlight xtorch’s high-level API, graph data utilities, and C++ performance, particularly for scalable models like GraphSAGE and real-time applications.

The examples align with xtorch’s goal of simplifying deep learning in C++, making them ideal for the `xtorch-examples` repository’s graph-level GNN section.

#### Comparison with Existing Practices
Popular deep learning libraries like PyTorch Geometric provide GNN tutorials, such as “Graph Classification with GIN” ([PyTorch Geometric Tutorials](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), which covers GIN on molecular datasets. The proposed xtorch examples mirror this approach but adapt it to C++, emphasizing xtorch’s unique features like the Trainer API, real-time performance, and OpenCV integration. They also include modern GNN architectures (e.g., EdgeConv, global attention pooling) and tasks (e.g., real-time classification, transfer learning) to stay relevant to current trends, as seen in repositories like “pyg-team/pytorch_geometric” ([GitHub - pyg-team/pytorch_geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric)).

#### Implementation Notes
- **Directory Structure**: Organize `xtorch-examples` with a `time_series_and_graph_neural_networks/graph_level_tasks/` directory, containing subdirectories for each example (e.g., `diffpool_proteins/`, `mpnn_qm9/`).
- **User Guidance**: The main `README.md` should list all examples, suggest a learning path (e.g., start with DiffPool, then GIN, then EdgeConv), and link to xtorch’s documentation.
- **C++ Focus**: Ensure code uses modern C++ practices (e.g., smart pointers, exception handling) and includes detailed comments for clarity.
- **Dependencies**: Note that users need LibTorch, xtorch, graph datasets (e.g., TUDataset, QM9, OGBG-MolHIV, ZINC, OGBG-MolPCBA, MUTAG), and optionally OpenCV installed, with download and setup instructions in each README. Graph data handling may require custom utilities or integration with C++ graph libraries.
