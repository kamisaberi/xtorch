### Detailed Model Parallelism Examples for xtorch

This document expands the "Performance and Distributed and Parallel Training -> Model Parallelism" subcategory of examples for the xtorch library, a C++ deep learning framework that extends PyTorch’s LibTorch API with user-friendly abstractions. The goal is to provide a comprehensive set of beginner-to-intermediate examples that introduce users to model parallelism techniques for distributed and parallel training, with a focus on time series and graph models to align with the broader "Time Series and Graph" context. These examples showcase xtorch’s capabilities in scalability, performance, and C++ ecosystem integration, and are designed to be included in the `xtorch-examples` repository, helping users learn model parallelism in C++.

#### Background and Context
xtorch simplifies deep learning for C++ developers by offering high-level model classes (e.g., `XTModule`, `ResNetExtended`, `XTCNN`), a streamlined training loop via the Trainer module, enhanced data utilities (e.g., `ImageFolderDataset`, `CSVDataset`, `DataLoader`), extended optimizers (e.g., `xtorch::optim`), and model serialization tools. The original model parallelism example—splitting models across GPUs for training—provides a solid foundation. This expansion adds seven more examples to cover additional model parallelism strategies (e.g., layer-wise parallelism, pipeline parallelism, hybrid parallelism), model types (e.g., LSTM, GCN, GraphSAGE), and training scenarios (e.g., real-time training, large-scale graph processing), ensuring a broad introduction to model parallelism with a focus on time series and graph applications.

The current time is 2:45 PM PDT on Monday, April 21, 2025, and all considerations are based on available information from the xtorch GitHub repository ([xtorch GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kamisaberi/xtorch)) without contradicting this timeframe.

#### Expanded Examples
The following table provides a detailed list of eight "Performance and Distributed and Parallel Training -> Model Parallelism" examples, including the original one and seven new ones. Each example is designed to be standalone, with a clear focus on a specific model parallelism concept or xtorch feature, making it accessible for users.

#### Implementation Details
Each example should be implemented as a standalone C++ program in the `xtorch-examples` repository, with the following structure:
- **Source Code**: A `main.cpp` file containing the example code, using xtorch’s model parallelism utilities (e.g., `xtorch::distributed::ModelParallel`), distributed utilities (e.g., `xtorch::distributed`), modules (e.g., `xtorch::nn`, `xtorch::optim`, `xtorch::data::DataLoader`), and, where applicable, OpenMPI for multi-node parallelism and OpenCV for visualization.
- **Build Instructions**: A `CMakeLists.txt` file to compile the example, linking against xtorch, LibTorch, OpenMPI (if needed), and OpenCV (if needed).
- **README.md**: A detailed guide explaining the example’s purpose, prerequisites (e.g., LibTorch, dataset downloads, OpenMPI, OpenCV, multi-GPU setup), steps to run, and expected outputs (e.g., training speed, latency, accuracy, RMSE, MAE, AUC-ROC, or visualization quality).
- **Dependencies**: Ensure users have xtorch, LibTorch, datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, UCI Appliances, Cora, PhysioNet ECG, QM9, PPI, custom IoT), and optionally OpenMPI and OpenCV installed, with download and setup instructions in each README. Multi-GPU and multi-node setups require appropriate hardware (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs, cluster nodes) and MPI configurations. Graph datasets may require custom utilities or integration with C++ graph libraries.

For example, the “Pipeline Parallelism for Graph Node Classification” might include:
- **Code**: Train a GCN on the Cora dataset using pipeline parallelism with `xtorch::distributed::ModelParallel`, splitting layers across GPUs, integrate with OpenMPI, optimize with `xtorch::optim::RMSprop` and cross-entropy loss, and output training speed and test accuracy, using xtorch’s modules and utilities.
- **Build**: Use CMake to link against xtorch, LibTorch, and OpenMPI, specifying paths to Cora dataset.
- **README**: Explain pipeline parallelism for graph models, provide compilation and training commands for multi-GPU setups, and show sample output (e.g., training speed of 120 batches/second, test accuracy of ~0.85).

#### Why These Examples?
These examples are designed to:
- **Cover Core Concepts**: From basic model parallelism and layer-wise splitting to pipeline parallelism, multi-node parallelism, and hybrid parallelism, they introduce key model parallelism paradigms for time series and graph applications.
- **Leverage xtorch’s Strengths**: They highlight xtorch’s `xtorch::distributed`, `xtorch::nn`, `xtorch::optim`, and `xtorch::data` modules, as well as C++ performance, particularly for scalable and distributed training of large models.
- **Be Progressive**: Examples start with simpler techniques (splitting models across GPUs) and progress to complex ones (multi-node, hybrid parallelism), supporting a learning path.
- **Address Practical Needs**: Techniques like pipeline parallelism, hybrid parallelism, and real-time training are widely used in real-world applications, from IoT to bioinformatics.
- **Encourage Exploration**: Examples like visualization-integrated parallelism and large-scale graph parallelism expose users to cutting-edge distributed training scenarios, fostering innovation.

#### Feasibility and Alignment with xtorch
The examples are feasible given xtorch’s features, as outlined in its GitHub repository:
- **Model Parallelism Utilities**: xtorch’s `xtorch::distributed::ModelParallel` (built on LibTorch’s distributed backend) supports splitting models across GPUs and nodes, with pipeline parallelism and OpenMPI integration for multi-node setups.
- **Model Compatibility**: `xtorch::nn` modules (e.g., `Conv2d`, `LSTM`, custom graph layers) support CNNs, LSTMs, GCNs, and GraphSAGE for time series and graph tasks.
- **Data Handling**: `xtorch::data::DataLoader` and custom dataset classes handle image, time series, and graph datasets, with support for distributed data processing and preprocessing (e.g., normalization, feature extraction).
- **Training Pipeline**: The `Trainer` API simplifies distributed training loops, integrating with `xtorch::distributed` for synchronization, compatible with all examples.
- **Evaluation**: xtorch’s utilities support metrics like training speed, latency, accuracy, RMSE, MAE, AUC-ROC, and downstream task performance.
- **C++ Integration**: xtorch’s compatibility with OpenMPI enables multi-node parallelism, and OpenCV enables visualization of training metrics, enhancing user interaction.

The examples align with xtorch’s goal of simplifying deep learning in C++ and fit the "Time Series and Graph" context by emphasizing time series and graph parallel training, making them ideal for the `xtorch-examples` repository’s model parallelism section.

#### Comparison with Existing Practices
Popular deep learning libraries like PyTorch provide distributed training tutorials, such as “Model Parallelism in PyTorch” ([PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)), which cover Python-based model parallelism. The proposed xtorch examples adapt this approach to C++, leveraging xtorch’s `xtorch::distributed` module and C++ performance. They also include time series and graph-specific parallelism (e.g., UCI, Cora, QM9) and advanced scenarios (e.g., pipeline parallelism, hybrid parallelism) to align with the category and modern distributed training trends, as seen in repositories like “pyg-team/pytorch_geometric” for graph model parallelism ([GitHub - pyg-team/pytorch_geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric)).

#### Implementation Notes
- **Directory Structure**: Organize `xtorch-examples` with a `performance_and_distributed_and_parallel_training/model_parallelism/` directory, containing subdirectories for each example (e.g., `split_model_cifar10/`, `layer_wise_timeseries_uci/`).
- **User Guidance**: The main `README.md` should list all examples, suggest a learning path (e.g., start with splitting models, then pipeline parallelism, then multi-node), and link to xtorch’s documentation.
- **C++ Focus**: Ensure code uses modern C++ practices (e.g., smart pointers, exception handling) and includes detailed comments for clarity.
- **Dependencies**: Note that users need LibTorch, xtorch, datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10, UCI Appliances, Cora, PhysioNet ECG, QM9, PPI, custom IoT), and optionally OpenMPI and OpenCV installed, with download and setup instructions in each README. Multi-GPU and multi-node setups require appropriate hardware (e.g., NVIDIA GPUs, cluster nodes) and MPI configurations. Graph datasets may require custom utilities or integration with C++ graph libraries.
