     * @brief A functor to convert a grayscale tensor to an RGB tensor.
     *
     * This struct provides a callable object that transforms a grayscale tensor, typically with a single
     * channel (e.g., [H, W] or [1, H, W]), into an RGB tensor with three channels (e.g., [3, H, W]).
     * The conversion is performed by replicating the grayscale channel across the RGB dimensions,
     * suitable for preprocessing grayscale images in machine learning workflows using LibTorch.
