        // and then the frequency filtering happens on the *weights* W, not directly on x.

        // The request is for an "activation function." NFNs are more like a layer type.

        // or broadcastable to x. Let's assume alpha and beta are of the same shape as x, or broadcastable.

        // f(x; alpha, beta) = alpha * x + beta * sin(alpha * x + beta)
        // where alpha and beta are learnable parameters, possibly per-channel.
        // For this functional version, alpha and beta will be passed and assumed to be
        // broadcastable to x's shape.
